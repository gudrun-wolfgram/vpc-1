## 19 June 2020
{: #june-19-2020}

- **Updated custom images information:** A new [Planning for custom images](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-planning-custom-images) checklist is available. The migration procedure for migrating a virtual server instance from classic infrastructure to IBM Cloud VPC is enhanced. For more information, see [Migrating a virtual server from the classic infrastructure](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-migrate-vsi-to-vpc). 

## 02 June 2020
{: #june-02-2020}

The IBM Cloud Virtual Servers for VPC on POWER service is deprecated. As of 02 June 2020, you cannot provision new instances. Any instance that is still provisioned as of 22 August 2020 will be deleted. For more information, see the [End of Service Announcement for Virtual Servers for VPC on POWER](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/announcements/end-of-service-announcement-for-virtual-servers-for-vpc-on-power).

## 21 May 2020
{: #may-21-2020}

- **Auto Scale for VPC Beta:** Auto scale is now available in a limited beta. With auto scale, you can improve performance and costs by dynamically creating virtual server instances to meet the demands of your environment. For more information, see [Creating an instance group for auto scaling (Beta)](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-creating-auto-scale-instance-group). 

## 15 May 2020
{: #may-15-2020}

- **Load Balancer for VPC update:** Supports backend encryption (HTTPS for backend pool). See [Using load balancers for VPC](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-load-balancers) for details.

## 01 May 2020
{: #may-01-2020}

- **Customer-managed encryption (BYOK) beta:** Customer-managed Encryption (BYOK) is available in beta. You can now bring your own encryption keys, which can be stored in Key Protect or Hyper Protect Crypto Services within VPC. This gives you the ability to encrypt your VPC-enabled block storage at the volume level by using your own keys. For more information, see [Creating virtual server instances with customer-managed encryption (Beta)](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-creating-instances-byok).

- **Flow logs beta:** Flow logs are now available in beta. Flow logs allow you to collect, store, and present the Internet Protocol (IP) traffic going to and from networks within your VPC. For more information, see [About flow logs (Beta)](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-flow-logs).

- **UI enhancement:** You can now create a new subnet directly from the page where you create a new instance. 

## 21 April 2020
{: #apr-21-2020}

**New region:** The Frankfurt region is now available. For more information, see [Creating a VPC in a different region](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-creating-a-vpc-in-a-different-region).
  
## 03 April 2020
{: #apr-03-2020}

- **Load Balancer for VPC Update:** You can now access load balancer monitoring metrics (throughput, active connections, connection rate) using [IBM Cloud Monitoring with Sysdig](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-monitoring-metrics-sysdig). 
- The following cipher suites are supported for load balancer HTTPS listeners:
    - `TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384`
    - `TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256`
    - `TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256`
    - `TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384`
    - `TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256`
    - `TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256`

## 27 March 2020
{: #mar-27-2020}

- **{{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}} monitoring:** You can now monitor virtual server instances using {{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}}. Use the new **Add monitoring** button on the instance's **Monitoring** page to provision an instance of the monitoring service. If a monitoring instance is already provisioned for the region, use the **Launch monitoring** button to view metrics associated with the instance. For more information, see [Sysdig monitoring metrics](/docs/vpc?topic=virtual-servers-sysdig-monitoring-metrics). 
- **Updated styling:** VPC pages in {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} console now use [Carbon 10](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/){: external}, IBM's open-source design system, which improves consistency and quality.
